<h1> Wikipedia Viewer </h1>
<h3>Free Code Camp</h3>

<h2>Objective:</h2>
Build a CodePen.io app that successfully allows the user to search Wikipedia.

<h2>Rules:</h2>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Don't look at the example project's code on CodePen. Figure it out for yourself.</li>
  <li>You may use whichever libraries or APIs you need.</li>
  <li>Reverse engineer the example project's functionality, and also feel free to personalize it.<li>
  </ul>
 </p>

<h2>User Stories:</h2>
<p>In software development and product management, a user story is a description consisting of one or more sentences in the everyday or business language of the end user or user of a system that captures what a user does or needs to do as part of his or her job function.</p>
<p> As a user, 
  <ol>
  <li>I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.</li>
  <li>As a user, I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.</li>
  <li>As a user, when I type in the search box, I can see a dropdown menu with autocomplete options for matching Wikipedia entries.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h2>Hints:</h2>
<p>
  <ol>
  <li>Here's a URL you can use to get a random Wikipedia article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random</a></li>
  <li>Here's an entry on using Wikipedia's API: <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page"></a>https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<strong>Do not use templates for this zipline.</strong>

CodePen.io overrides the Window.open() function, so if you want to open windows using jQuery, you will need to target invisible anchor elements like this one: <a target='_blank'>.
